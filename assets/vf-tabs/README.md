# Tabs Component

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-tabs.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-tabs)

## About

The ever-useful tabs. This component works best with the included JS, but you can use the CSS styling on other tab sets, like Bootstrap tabs. 

## Install

This component is distributed with npm. After [installing npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm), you can install the `vf-tabs` with this command.

```
$ yarn add --dev @visual-framework/vf-tabs
```

The source files included are written in [Sass](http://sass-lang.com)(`scss`). You can point your Sass `include-path` at your `node_modules` directory and import it like this.

```
@import "@visual-framework/vf-tabs/index.scss";
```

_Make sure you import Sass requirements along with the modules._
