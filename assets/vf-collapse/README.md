# vf-collapse Component

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-collapse.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40visual-framework%2Fvf-collapse)

Collapse and expand components are useful in a variety of utilitarian situations to show and hide information 

- These will likely be similar in functionality to the [Bootstrap collapse component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/collapse/)
- We may use the `<detail>` element

This is a draft component, it is not yet functional. Background on the implementation, goals and work plan [can be found in the issue](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/issues/275).

## Install

This repository is distributed with [npm][npm]. After [installing npm][install-npm], you can install `vf-collapse` with this command.
