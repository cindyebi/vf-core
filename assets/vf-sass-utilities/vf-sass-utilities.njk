<div class="vf-content">

{% markdown %}
### Available Sass utilities

### Et al.

- `.vf-et-al` for use in publications lists and similar

<span class="vf-et-al">Jon Smith, Jane Johnson, </span>

### Screenreader text

- `.vf-sr-only` some things should only be shown to screen readers

<span class="vf-sr-only">Like this text</span>

### No-wrap.

- `.vf-no-wrap` keep text together, as much as possible

I'm some words that can break awkwardly but keep the <span class="vf-no-wrap">Company Name</span> together.
